#WP Backbone

A simple proof-of-concept theme for WordPress based on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [JSON REST API](https://github.com/rmccue/wp-api) plugin.

## Using
1. Install [JSON REST API](https://github.com/rmccue/wp-api) plugin.
2. Set the permalinks to `/posts/%post_id%/%postname%/`
3. Activate the theme

## Current Features
Right now only it only can do the following
